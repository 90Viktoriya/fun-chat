Task: [link](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/stage2/tasks/fun-chat/README.md)

The application is a client for a chat service that operates over WebSocket. The client application enables users to send messages, view chat history, and also allows senders to delete and edit messages. Each browser tab with this application can be used as a separate client.

**Please note**, chat also requires a **separate local server** to be running for its functionality. This server handles chat features, message storage, and user management. Before starting the client application, you have to clone the [server application](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/fun-chat-server/tree/main), launch the local server, and maintain the server application's operation as needed..
